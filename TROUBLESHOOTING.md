# TROUBLESHOOTING

Tips and hints for installing, using, and troubleshooting problems with qStudio:

1. Double-clicking the `.jar` file starts the GUI. It doesn't provide
much diagnostic information.

2. The **Console** window shows the SQL generated from the PRQL query.
It also shows any error messages from parsing the query or executing it.

3. To get more information, launch qStudio from the command line.
The terminal session displays a lot of logging information.

   ```
   cd directory-containing-qstudio.jar
   java -jar qstudio.jar
   ```
   
4. qStudio also saves a log of its operations in a _qstudio_ directory
  in the user's home directory.

5. The `prqlc` binary must be installed and available to qStudio.
  * **On macOS**, the easiest way to install `prqlc` is with
  the [Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh/).
  It will install the current binary and make it available on the PATH.
  (Homebrew is a terrific tool because it does not
  require any superuser permissions,
  and saves all its files in a few well-known directories.)
  Test the installation by typing `prqlc --version`.
  * **On Windows**, the easiest way to install `prqlc` is to use
  [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/).
  Use `winget install prqlc`.
  You may need to open a new terminal window before testing with `prqlc --version`.
 
6. **First run:**
  On macOS, the operating system will refuse to run qStudio when
  you double-click its icon in the Finder.
  To solve this, open **System Preferences -> Security & Privacy**.
  There will likely be a message to the effect, "qStudio is from
  an untrusted developer...".
  Click "Open anyway..." and confirm that you want to run the program.
  Alternatively, use `java -jar qstudio.jar` as described above.
